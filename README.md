# Exploring the Unique Sounds: A Comparison of Three Distinct Music Genres

## My Corpus choice

My corpus consists of a collection of songs from various genres including mainly Pop, Rap, and Phonk (which is a sub genre of hip hop and
trap music). This corpus was chosen because I want to explore the differences and similarities among these various genres in terms of
their musical characteristics. Initially these three main genres within my corpus seem very different, so I thought it would be
interesting to see if there were any specific overlapping musical characteristics which makes them so compelling for my taste in music. Something interesting to keep in mind: I personally listen to these different genres under various circumstances. For example I tend to listen mostly to Pop when studying, while when working out I like to listen to Rap to give me that extra energy, and finally when gaming I tend to listen mostly to Phonk to focus in a game.

## Comparisons

The natural comparison points in my corpus are therefore the different genres: Pop, Rap, and Phonk. I expect to see differences in terms
of rhythm, melody, harmony, and lyrics. For example, I expected Pop music to have a more upbeat rhythm and catchy lyrics compared to Rap
music which might have a heavier beat and very different flowing lyrics. However, I also expected to see some similarities across genres,
for example Rap and Phonk often seem to have a similar type beat and rhythm: heavy and fast paced. It will be interesting to explore the
similarity and differences regarding the instruments and music keys/notes used in typical songs of each genre.

The tracks in my corpus are representative of the groups I want to compare, as I selected them based on their popularity and mainstream
recognition within each genre. However, it is possible that my corpus might not cover all sub-genres within each main genre, and therefore
may not represent the full scope of each genre.

Some examples of typical tracks in my corpus are "Invincible" by Pop Smoke, a popular Rap/Hiphop song, and "Counting Stars" by
OneRepublic, a popular Pop song with its iconic vocal harmonies and theatrical elements. Atypical tracks in my corpus include "Sweater
Weather" by the Neighbourhood, which is a mix between Indie rock and alternative rock, and "break from toronto" by PartyNextDoor, which
could be classified as R&B or Hiphop but also contains a form of rap. These atypical songs may cause there to be some outliers in the data.
These outliers may have to be filtered out first in order to be able to make the most fair comparison for each genre.

In conclusion, this portfolio will focus on exploring and analyzing the musical characteristics of Pop, Rap, and Phonk, to find out what
makes them appealing to listen to under various circumstances.
