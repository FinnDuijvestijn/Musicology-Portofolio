# Musicology-Portofolio

For my corpus I chose a collection of songs from various genres including mainly Pop, Rap, Hiphop and Phonk. I chose this corpus because I wanted to explore the differences and similarities among various genres in terms of their musical characteristics.

The natural comparison points in my corpus are the different genres. I expect to see differences in terms of rhythm, melody, harmony, and lyrics. For example, I expect Pop music to have a more upbeat rhythm and catchy lyrics compared to Rap music which might have a heavier beat and very different lyrics. However, I also expect to see some similarities across genres, for example some artist make songs in different types of genres which could lead to similar intruments used or the same type of lyrics. 

The tracks in my corpus are representative of the groups I want to compare, as I selected them based on their popularity and mainstream recognition within each genre. However, it is possible that my corpus might not cover all sub-genres within each main genre, and therefore may not represent the full scope of each genre.

Some examples of typical tracks in my corpus are "Invincible" by Pop Smoke, a popular Rap/Hiphop song, and "Counting Stars" by OneRepublic, a popular Pop song with its iconic vocal harmonies and theatrical elements. Atypical tracks in my corpus include "Sweater Weather" by the Neighbourhood, which is a mix between Indie rock and alternative rock, and "break from toronto" by PartyNextDoor, which could be classified as R&B or Hiphop but also contains a form of rap.

In conclusion, my corpus provides a glimpse into the musical characteristics of various popular genres, and offers opportunities for comparison and analysis.
